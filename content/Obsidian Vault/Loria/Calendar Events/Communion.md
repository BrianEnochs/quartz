Communion is a holiday celebrated by paladins and priests of [[Heironeous]], the god of justice, valor, chivalry, and honor. It is a day dedicated to introspection and personal reflection. On this day, followers of [[Heironeous]] take time to meditate on their own beliefs and values, and to consider how they can better align themselves with the virtues that their god represents. Many paladins and priests may also spend this day in prayer, asking for guidance and strength in their ongoing battle against evil. Communion is typically a quiet and peaceful day, with little in the way of public celebrations or gatherings. It is a time where followers of [[Heironeous]] seek to deepen their connection to their god and to reaffirm their commitment to his teachings.
