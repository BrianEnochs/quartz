**Date**: 6 Feastmun

The Flower's Fall is a solemn and reflective holiday that is celebrated by followers of the goddess [[Ehlonna]]. It is the counterpart to the [[Flowerâ€™s Rise]]. During the Flower's Fall, the garland that was hung in the home during the Flower's Rise is taken down and returned to the earth. This is seen as a symbolic gesture, representing the passage of time and the cycle of life and death.

The Flower's Fall is usually accompanied by a modest fair or gathering, where people come together to dance, sing, and enjoy each other's company. The fair often features traditional music and dance, as well as food and drink vendors, games and activities, and other entertainment. It is a time of celebration and joy, but it is also a time of reflection and contemplation.

This reflection and contemplation often takes the form of examining the past year, and making plans for the coming one. They may set goals or make resolutions, and they may also engage in spiritual or religious rituals, such as prayer, meditation, or offerings to the goddess. The Flower's Fall is a time of transition and change, and it is an opportunity for people to come together and reaffirm their commitment to [[Ehlonna]] and the forest.

Overall, the Flower's Fall is a time of celebration, reflection, and renewal. It is a holiday that is deeply rooted in the traditions and beliefs of [[Ehlonna]]'s followers, and it is an opportunity for people to come together and celebrate the beauty and bounty of the forest.
