Auril is the goddess of winter and cold, a malevolent deity who delights in the misery of mortals. She is often depicted as a tall and frost-bitten woman, with pale skin and ice-blue eyes. Her long white hair is said to be made of snowflakes, and she is often accompanied by a pack of vicious ice wolves.

Auril is a powerful deity, and is said to wield immense control over the forces of cold and ice. She is able to summon blizzards and ice storms at will, and is known to use her powers to freeze her enemies in place or encase them in ice. She is also said to be able to grant her followers the ability to resist the cold and to heal frostbite and other cold-related injuries.

Despite her fearsome powers, Auril is generally considered to be a distant and aloof goddess, who does not often intervene in the affairs of mortals. She is said to be cold and unemotional, and is often depicted as being indifferent to the suffering of those around her. Those who worship her do so out of fear, hoping to placate her wrath and avoid her wrathful gaze.

Overall, Auril is a powerful and dangerous deity, one who should be treated with caution and respect by those who encounter her. Her followers are few, but they are often fierce and dedicated, willing to do whatever it takes to please their cruel goddess.
